            Every child is born full of creativity. Nurturing it is one of the most important things educators do. Creativity makes your students better communicators and problem solvers. It prepares them to thrive in today’s world — and to shape tomorrow’s. Apple is constantly creating resources to help educators do just that. Not only powerful products, but also tools, inspiration, and curricula to create magical learning experiences and make every moment of screen time worth it.

        <div id="second"> <strong>iPad and Mac</strong><br>
            Apple products give students complete freedom of expression. iPad is so intuitive, anyone can instantly take an idea and run with it. Mac provides the power to pursue the most ambitious projects. Students can even start creating on iPad, then pick up where they left off on Mac. And with all-day battery life, iPad and Mac keep going long after the last class is over.

            <p>Establishing Goals</p>
            <p class="quote">“We all met to come up with our vision, mission statement, goals, and challenges.”</p>
            <p>Every school faces unique challenges. That’s why we meet with administrators from each Apple ConnectED school to craft a vision for the role of technology in their classrooms. As part of this planning, we work with school leadership to form a core group of individuals responsible for defining clear and measurable goals.</p>

            <p>At Berkley Campostella Early Childhood Education Center in Norfolk, Virginia, Principal Dr. Doreatha White leads her faculty with a powerful vision — that children are capable of anything if you give them the right tools. “Our motto is: College begins in prekindergarten,” she says. “We have to guide a student’s whole thinking toward being successful beyond pre-K. But to truly start closing the digital divide, we have to get our parents and the community to believe in what we’re doing as well.”</p>

        <div id="fourth">
            <p class="quote">“When something’s on iPad, it’s automatically fun.”</p>
            <p>Apple has been part of the ConnectED initiative since 2014, pledging $100 million of teaching and learning solutions to 114 underserved schools across the country. We’ve donated an iPad to every student, a Mac and iPad to every teacher, and an Apple TV to every classroom. And we’ve implemented a process that provides planning, professional learning, and ongoing guidance so every school can experience the transformational power of technology.</p>
